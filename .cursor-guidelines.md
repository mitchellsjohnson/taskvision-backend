# Cursor Guidelines for TaskVision Backend

Please follow these rules when assisting with code in this repository:

## Testing
- Always write unit tests for all exported functions, modules, and endpoints.
- Remind us to run `npm test` before any manual testing or deployment.
- Suggest mocks for Auth0 tokens and roles if needed in tests for protected endpoints.

## Auth0 + Security
- Ensure that any Post-Login Action code includes role injection:
  ```js
  api.accessToken.setCustomClaim("https://taskvision-server-api.com/roles", roleNames);
  ```

## Local Environment
- This project uses a `.env.local` file for local environment variables.
- Important: This file is gitignored. Do not assume it doesn't exist. If you suspect an environment variable issue, please ask about the contents of `.env.local` rather than concluding it is missing.
